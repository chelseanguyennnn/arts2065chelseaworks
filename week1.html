      <h2>First Person Narrative did in tutorial: My best friend</h2>
      <div class="narrative-box">
        <p>It’s 6p.m.</p>
        <p>“Mom, Emi and I are going to the library!”</p>
        <p>I rush out of home, knowing full well we’re not going anywhere near a “library.” Emi and I promised each other since we were 5 or 6 years old that we will share all the happiness and sadness together. She just got rejected by her first ever crush, I have to drop my unfinished homework and come to her.  Hmmm, how could I cheer this silly girl up? Tell her not to care about the unworthy one? Showcasing some ridiculous performances so she can laugh? Ride her around the city like we have always done? </p>
        <p>“Emiiiiii! Oh, hello auntie, yes, there is a presentation in class tomorrow.”</p>
        <p>I see her. She looks exhausted.</p>
        <p>I know she likes that boy a lot. She tried so hard to show him her best side. But in my eyes, she has always been so good in her own way. I don’t want her to be sad. I don’t want to say anything that make her feels worse.</p>
        <p>“Let’s go Emi, I just found out this fantastic Cafe nearby.”</p>
