            <p>This project explores the question: “What will AI do to us, humans, if we continue exploiting it as we do today?”</p>
            <p>The first piece is an essay debating the ethics of using AI in academic environments and its potential impacts. The second is a speculative video history of AI, created using AI-generated images, videos, and sounds, and edited in Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>

          <div class="card-video">
            <iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oj7y8AOfiYc" title="Week 1 video" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>
          <p class="card-desc"> <i>Seriously?</i> is about a young man bursting into a classroom and grabbing his water bottle in desperation, only to discover that it’s completely empty. The audience later sees the reason behind it through a flashback scene.</p>
          <p class="card-desc">In W1, I was assigned as cameraman. I learnt that cinematography is not always about aesthetics, but how we convey the storytelling with different kinds of shots (POV, flashback, high/low angles) is also crucial.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="week-card" role="listitem" tabindex="0">
          <h3>Week 2,  Transformative Photo (like Haneke's Cache), break the rules of composition</h3>
          <div class="card-video">
            <iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IsM6ldvR0YE" title="Week 2 video" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <p class="card-desc"><i>(In)Sane</i>'s purpose is to utilise the use of a tripod to turn a photo into a moving sequence. At first, everything is static, but a moment comes, and the protagonist’s world can’t stop shaking. As well as her mental health.</p>
          <p class="card-desc">I was the actor during W2. It fits perfectly, as I remember having a mental breakdown during that week; it was advantageous since I could release those emotions through the screen</p>
        </div>
        <div class="week-card" role="listitem" tabindex="0">
          <h3>Week 3, Film Grammar POV exercises (STALKING)</h3>

          <p class="card-desc"><i>Mis-Seen</i> wants to depict funny moments when misunderstandings occur between people. When a boy whose blurred world turns upside down after he loses his glasses. A girl’s simple act of kindness leads to a moment of confusion and misunderstanding.</p>
          <p class="card-desc">I was doing sound in W3. To be honest, this was the week where I struggled to understand the technique the most, and I think our team might have misunderstood the task a bit. Nevertheless, my teammate’s camera quality was so excellent that we managed to have the best footage in all weeks.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="card-desc"> <i>Deep-in-a-Gen-Z-way conversations</i> is just a simple shot-reverse-shot exercise, illustrating typical deep conversations in our generation :)</p>
          <p class="card-desc">Since we did not have time for this exercise, we tried to make a rapid script (in our heads) but of course avoided normal small-coffee talk. As for me, I found it difficult to memorise the lines from earlier takes since the first attempt was completely spontaneous. </p>

          <h3>Week 9, Editing Exercise</h3>

          </div>
          <p class="card-desc"><i>Colour in Your Eyes </i> conveys a simple meaning: life becomes more colourful when you look at things you like.</p>
          <p class="card-desc">We shoot random shots of different objects and an eye staring at those objects. Perhaps this exercise is to test our diverse sense of editing. My teammate showed me her edit in class, and it was completely different from mine.</p>

              <p><strong>(Dear em,)</strong> follows a 19-year-old girl through the quiet collapse of her family and her sense of self. In memories, loneliness, and healing, she learns that letting go is part of growing up. Inspired by the creator's own story, the short film captures that fragile space between girlhood and becoming.</p>

                <p>I immediately knew that the setting must be Centennial Park, my favourite green space.</p>
                <p>My dilemma: to tell or not to tell? To reveal it or keep it buried forever? To grow up or stay small? Too complicated – so I made it the main conflict of the photo essay.</p>
                <p>On the test day, I bought a helium balloon from a party shop in Bondi Junction, went to the park, sat there and looked at the sky.</p>
                <p>The ideating process was fairly smooth, even with the story I wanted to tell or the concept. But at the end, I changed mostly the way I approach it.</p>
