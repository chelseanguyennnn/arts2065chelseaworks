        <h2>Not a synopsis but a confession</h2>
        <div class="project0-confession">
          <p>This was my first ever media or art-related project, also the first time I took on the role of director. Before coming to Australia and before uni, my younger self always thought I would be a “business school girlie” (which I still kind of am LOL) and follow my parents’ path. I never imagined I’d end up doing anything creative. But thanks to media school, I’ve never felt bored again. Media has helped me escape boredom, which I personally believe is one of the hardest human urges to resist.</p>
          <p><em>Fun fact:</em> I haven’t watched this piece again yet. I want to keep improving my skill until I finally feel satisfied. Only then will I allow myself to watch it.</p>
          <p><strong>So this is simply a voice from a girl who misses home, who feels homesick, who is “nhớ nhà.”</strong></p>
          <p> Please enjoy watching it :)</p>
